/// This file proposes a set of functions to handle the signals in your program.
/// Typically, you want to print the stack trace when there is a sigsev.
/// It also handles elegantly SIGINT and SIGTERM by catching them and allowing the program
/// to clean itself up before exiting (see handler_interruption). If a second SIGINT/SIGTERM is
/// received before the end of the clean up we exit immediately (return value 0).
